# Objective

Scale is an ever present topic in 

# Reading Rasters in R

```{r read nlcd}
# load necessary libraries
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(rgdal)  # R version of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
  library(raster)
  library(dplyr) # raster overrides: intersect, select, union
  })

# Set your working directory
setwd('/Users/bbest/github/landscape-ecology/wk02_scale/data')

# read rasters
nlcd_2001 = raster('nlcd_2001.tif')
nlcd_2006 = raster('nlcd_2006.tif')
nlcd_2011 = raster('nlcd_2011.tif')

nlcd_2001not2006 = nlcd_2001 != nlcd_2006

# plot
plot(nlcd_2011)

# get frequency of landcover classes
tbl = freq(nlcd_2001) %>%

# convert to area
nlcd_2001 # resolution  : 30, 30  (x, y)


```


# Spatial Scaling

- rescale landcover using majority vs central points

- interpolate using NEAREST for categorical (eg nlcd_2011) vs BILINEAR for continuous (slope)

 - change grain and extent, heterogenous and homogenous (randomize location of landcover, then rescale) to generate Wiens Fig 1 & 2.

# Forecasting using a Markov Model

- probability matrix
