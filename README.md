# landscape-ecology-labs
Landscape Ecology labs taught winter quarter 2015 at Bren School, UCSB. Originally posted in a classroom project. Just quickly posting some of the content here to demonstrate materials for [NEON spatio-temporal data hackathon](http://www.neoninc.org/updates-events/events/hackathon-spatio-temporal-data-lesson-building).

Used Rmarkdown to weave data prep and processing/visualization, using different external software each week (Maxent, Marxan, Circuitscape, LANDIS, vegan...).
