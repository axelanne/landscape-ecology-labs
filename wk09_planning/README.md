Case study of urban and regional planning that incorporate landscape ecological principles

[The Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan](http://www.pima.gov/CMO/SDCP/index.html)

[Linking Colorado's Landscapes](http://rockymountainwild.org/srep/linking-colorados-landscapes) (have a look at Phase 1 and Phase 2 reports. There are links at this site.)

Please systematically examine these projects. Ask yourself the following questions:

1. Who are the key organizations and participants in the planning process?

1. What are the main planning goals and objectives?

1. What is the planning scale?

1. Where in the planning process are landscape ecological theory and tools applied?

1. How are social and ecological perspectives considered and integrated?

1. Is the plan being successfully implemented? Does the planning process appear to be effective? Based on what evidence?

1. Do you see any obvious opportunities to improve the planning process?

Would you rather look at another area plan asking the same questions? That would be fine too. Please send me the link so I can have a look.
