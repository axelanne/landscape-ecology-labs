## Questions

On your small answer sheet, write your name and the most minimal form of the
answer.

1. **Fahrig (2003)** _Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity_.

    Choose the most applicable thesis statement.

  - a. Habitat fragmentation always has a negative impact on biodiversity.

  - b. Habitat loss cannot be distinguished from isolation of habitat patches when measuring the effects of fragmentation on biodiversity.

  - c. Generally, habitat loss has a strong negative impact on biodiversity, whereas the breaking apart of habitat patches is weaker and less predictable.

  - b. continuous surface metrics (roughness, height distribution, angular and radial texture)
  - c. metrics from discrete patches based on categorical surfaces

3. **Wu (2013)** _Use and misuse of landscape indices_.

    Which of the following were not explicitly criticqued by Wu:
