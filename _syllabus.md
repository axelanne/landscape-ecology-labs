# Overview

> The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in
seeing with new eyes.
-- Marcel Proust

Rather than cataloguing the variety of landscapes or ecosystems on earth, the
field of Landscape Ecology (LE) provides methods to describe the interaction
between spatial patterns and ecological processes for any landscape. We'll begin
our "voyage of discovery" into this unique geographic perspective by exploring
scaling issues, causal agents (physical, biotic and human) and metrics to
quantify landscape pattern. Landscapes are hardly static, so understanding
disturbance regimes and impacts is essential. Then we'll build up from habitats
of individual species and connectivity across the landscape, to a multi-species
community perspective, culminating in evaluating conservation plans that
integrate LE concepts. Finally we'll review unique LE applications across
disperate ecosystems, including seascapes and soundscapes.

# Format

Our two weekly meeting times will be broken into lecture on Tuesdays in Bren
Hall 1424 and labs on Thursdays in the GIS lab.

## Lectures and Readings

Lectures (other than the first) will begin with a brief quiz on the assigned
readings from the primary literature (not the textbook chapters). For the last
15 minutes of lecture, these assigned readings will be discussed. Discussions
are to be led by one student per reading who will posit questions to the class,
with the possibility of using visual aids (eg PowerPoint presentation). It is
encouraged to highlight strengths and weaknesses in the paper, while providing
contextual relevance to landscape ecology fundamentals and modern conservation
applications. Students assigned to a reading can suggest an alternate reading up
to a week before the lecture. In order to be approved it must be relevant to
that week's lecture topic and be of sufficient quality.

For the remainder of lecture I will present concepts and examples from the
textbook and primary literature, welcoming questions and comments throughout for
a conversational tone.

## Labs and Group Project

Weekly labs will apply analytical techniques towards Santa Barbara County as the
backyard study area, and relate concepts from the preceding lecture. The first
two labs will orient you to ArcGIS and R while conducting tasks related to
assessing and forecasting landcover. I will provide introductions to these
software. Those with past experience are encouraged to help their neighbor with
less experience navigate the software (but not complete the assignment). Each
student will build distribution and connectivity models for different species,
all of which will be collated for use in the community lab.

The final conservation planning lab will be conducted as a group project. Each
group will present on a different objective in the final lab meeting and turn in
a report by the end of the following week.

During our scheduled Thursday lab sessions and besides the final lab reserved
for presentation of group projects, I will introduce labs briefly, leaving as
much time as possible to work through instructions and provide hands-on help.
Colored stickies slapped to the top of a monitor will let you quietly flag
whether you need help (red) or successfully completed a given step (green). Labs
are due the following Wednesday at noon.

## Field Trip

An optional weekend day trip to northern Santa Barbara County will allow us to
seek these LE patterns and processes in the field. You'll get extra credit for
attending and are encouraged to further sign up as a field guide by choosing a
topic (geology, fire, birds, trees, etc), creating a one page field guide
specific to Santa Barbara county and highlight objects on site.

In the modern vein of citizen science and crowd sourcing, expect to digitally
record species observations via GPS enabled camera (ie smartphone) for
submission to iNaturalist. Might enlist a quadcopter drone to capture aerial
photography for comparison with satellite data.

# Makeup

Please notify me if you cannot attend or arrive late to a lecture. To make up
points for the quiz, you will need to provide a summary of the readings and
textbook chapters within the following week. You should define key concepts and
present overall results, and it must be limited to 1 page. Outline form is
acceptable.
